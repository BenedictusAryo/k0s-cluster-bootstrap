Thank you for installing the cluster-init Helm chart!

- All cluster-wide infrastructure (Cilium, Sealed Secrets, ArgoCD, MetalLB, etc.) is managed by this chart.
- After installation, run the scripts in `cluster-init/scripts/` to generate secrets and trigger the GitOps flow.
- Serverless workloads are managed by the cluster-serverless Helm chart, referenced as an app-of-apps from this chart.
